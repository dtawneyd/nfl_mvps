# nfl_mvps
This is a small project I wrote to determine the percentage of NFL MVPs that also won Superbowl MVP.
I started this project because I wanted to practice with data scraping and visualization. After I started with the project, I realized that plotting this data wasn't necessary since it was only dealing with either they did or did not win both. So instead of plotting at the end, I used a simple print statement giving the average.
